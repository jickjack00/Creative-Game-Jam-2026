# spaghetti

there's a lot of spaghetti stuff here, do not delete anything unless it's truly necessary
## this means you shouldn't delete anything, pretty much

if you do there will be *dire* consequences... **dire** consequences.......

## ALTERNATIVELY,
i could spend hours trying to deduce every single slight connection every item has with another so i can delete them myself and save a lot of space and trouble but i don't have time for that
just don't delete anything please :)
